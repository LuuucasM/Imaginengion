# Imaginengion
### A high-performance game engine designed to leverage emerging technologies with a strong focus on cache locality and modern hardware optimization. Built from the ground up in Zig, it aims to push the boundaries of real-time performance by optimizing data structures, minimizing CPU cache misses, and leveraging Zig's easy-to-use compile time processing.

### Compatability
Currently compiles using the newest master-version x86_64 zig compiler from the website https://ziglang.org/download/
There is plan to extend compatability to other systems in the future but for now there is too many other things to develop
to warrent additional compatability

### Instillation
1. Have this repo downloaded and in its own folder
2. Have the master-version x86_64 zig compiler installed
3. Run FirstBuild.bat

Step 3 should produce a GameEngine.exe in the same folder as the .bat file. Run this exe.
