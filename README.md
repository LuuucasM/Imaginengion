## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
I havnt written a proper introduction yet ^_^

## Compatability and Instillation <a name="CandI"></a>
### Compatability
Currently compiles using the newest master-version x86_64 zig compiler from the website https://ziglang.org/download/
There is plan to extend compatability to other systems in the future but for now there is too many other things to develop
to warrent additional compatability

### Instillation
1. Have this repo downloaded and in its own folder
2. Have the master-version x86_64 zig compiler installed
3. Run FirstBuild.bat file provided with the engine
4. Run GameEngine.exe (appears after running FirstBuild.bat)
