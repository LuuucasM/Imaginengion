- So firstly I have decided I am going to change the delete component to match the add component in the ECS. such that it will support automatic deletion of "Unique" and "Multiple" component categories (is what I'm calling components who there can only be 1 of in an entity, and components which there can be many in an entity)
- Then I need to modify my engine to utilize the new add component and remove component methods properly.
- Then I can finish up adding event types for removing components
