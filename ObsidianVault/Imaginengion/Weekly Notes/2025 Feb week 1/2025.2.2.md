- Move SceneUtils and PlayerUtils into the SceneLayer/Player objects
	- idk why i created a new stateless file with functions for it when it makes it easier and more sense if its part of the Entity/SceneLayer/Player
- Add utility functions to scene for adding UUID component so that it adds the UUID to world_id map in the scene serializer
- change all the adding UUID components for both scripts and entities to use the new speicalized functions for adding UUID
- change toolbar panel so that it looks for spawn components on any of the scenes and lets you choose one of those with the dropdown bar instead of how it is now
	- this means that when you press play it will spawn a player (maybe more than one in the future) and follow the spawn logic of that spawn component 
- still need to change the serializer, specifically for de-serializing scene/entity references I should do something like they will be serialized as "EntityRef" and "SceneRef" and write that objects UUID
- when deserializing I have to check for this specific string but when I do that I know I can make a ResolveUUID object for the UUID we deserialize after Entity/Scene Ref and then after deserializing the scene I can attempt to resolve references
	- i was thinking at first if it can not be resolved then it can be done just lazily like the next time the ocmponent tries to use the reference it will try to resolve it then but I dont really like the idea of this because it means if one scene heavily references stuff from another scene then if they are not loaded in the correct order there will have to be a lot of lazy evaluation
	- but now i am wondering if I can leverage the event system so that when things are serialized the objects who have dangling references can get a like deserialized event and try again
		- note i thought about keeping around ResolveUUID requests but then if an entity is deleted then that means i must go through that list and ensure all the requests this entity made get deleted, but this is a bit of an abitrary situation so i would have to do it for every entity deleted and that would definately be a performance cut in the long run
