- remember to talk about the input command queues and stuff that i implemented but then took it out because i thought i was being invasive to the devs memory print like most games wont really use it but it would still take the few hunna bytes of memory and even tho its not much it felt like from the engine perspective why should i force a game to have this when a game that would need it like a fighting game will implement their own high perofmrance system anyway
