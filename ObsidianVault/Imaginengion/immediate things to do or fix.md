- remove the idea of multi components entirely
	- change the entire script system 
		- the parent component now has a mFirstEntity and mFirstScript
		- scripts can now be directly added as children for the S in ECS
		- for all the systems that do calculations for childrens i need to change it to do the new system. good thing is the children are ALL entities in a heirarchy so all my current code works i just need to do it for both entity and script now
			- for example UpdateWorldTransforms does a child traversal
			- serialization will need to be changed again too :')
		- for imgui the scripts pane
			- the name of the script that appears in the script panel can be the name of the child entity. 
			- scripts will need to be able to be edited (like editor window) except a special editor window where it will display all 3, name + transform + script together 
			- dragging scripts into the script window will create a new child and add script to child
			- you can also right click on scripts panel to add new script which will just create a blank script with nothing
- change components panel to not just display any and all components of an entity but do what i do for serialization and create another comptime list of types that are for displaying
	- Limit components to 1 type per entity
	- also change the add component popup menu
		- I want to instead of being a button be a right click on the background of the panel
		- Then i can condense it into an inline for like i will do for component displaying since entities can only have 1 type of each

- fix ReloadAllScenes not working it is getting a buffer underrun (thanks to the new system deserializing somehow)
- make visualizer for sphere collision and box collision
- do next phase of physics engine
