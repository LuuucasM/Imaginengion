- fix ReloadAllScenes making textures break
	- probably something to do with getting asset handles and relesaing asset handles?
- change physics collider to use the build in entity transform rather than right now where the enum value is a struct "box" and struct "sphere". that way I can align the colliders with more how the rendering system works
	- this is so for the next TODO to visualize colliders i can simply follow my sdf logic to implement it
- make visualizer for sphere collision and box collision
- do next phase of physics engine
