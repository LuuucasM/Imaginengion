- I need to take a look at how/if/when scripts are removed
- change components panel to not just display any and all components of an entity but do what i do for serialization and create another comptime list of types that are for displaying
	- Limit components to 1 type per entity
	- also change the add component popup menu
		- I want to instead of being a button be a right click on the background of the panel
		- Then i can condense it into an inline for like i will do for component displaying since entities can only have 1 type of each
- change the name of some of the components to make more sense
	- change the entity to scene id component, right now called SceneIDComponent -> EntitySceneComponent.
	- change IDComponent to EntityUUIDComponent and SceneUUIDComponent instead to make it more clear

- fix ReloadAllScenes not working it is getting a buffer underrun (thanks to the new system deserializing somehow)
- make visualizer for sphere collision and box collision
- do next phase of physics engine
