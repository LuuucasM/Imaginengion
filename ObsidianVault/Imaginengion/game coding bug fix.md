- fix bug where if you cancel a SaveAs for scene it will crash with index out of bounds
	- I dont actually check to see if a path was gotten i just need a simple check and thats it
- add right click to add new scene to content browser panel
- add a custom jsonStringify and jsonParse to CameraComponent and then move camera component serialize function to be just basic component serialization and can get rid of serialize camera component
- add transforms to scenes
- change serializer so that it no longer needs to take in a scene asset and when calling save scene as no need to make the asset on disk before serializing so that it works now that it uses all rel paths
- add the ability to change TexCoord(UV).
	- on quad components first print just text the UV's
	- then on the same line beside it have a button that says like edit UVs
	- that button opens up a new panel where 
		- it is the texture image but like really big with 
		- 2 small circle dots on it representing the uv top left and uv bottom right
		- below the image there is an imgui drag float 2 for both top and bottom that the user can drag around or edit the exact number if they want
		- these 3 things gives the user to both set the UV visually ON the actual image, and then also programatically.
		- the only thing i am considering is if i should allow dragging of the dots on the image as it might be hard and i want to write as little imgui code as possible because id rather just replace imgui with my own UI stuff later
		- the one good thing is that the more accurate i make the imgui code now the better prepared i will be to make the switch because I will know exactly what i need from my engines own UI system to be able to recreate the engine gui
- add ability to render font
- add sound
