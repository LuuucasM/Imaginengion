- i need to add components at some point:
	- attribute component (multi)
	- collider component (multi)
	- rigid body component (unique)
	- particle component (dont know yet its so far away)
- add sound
- add physics
- add entity picking in the editor
- move away from "managed" structs. aka ones that keep reference to their own allocator, in favor of unmanaged and just passing around allocators more explicitly.
