- add the ability to change TexCoord(UV).
	- on quad components first print just text the UV's
	- then on the same line beside it have a button that says like edit UVs
	- that button opens up a new panel where 
		- it is the texture image but like really big with 
		- 2 small circle dots on it representing the uv top left and uv bottom right
		- below the image there is an imgui drag float 2 for both top and bottom that the user can drag around or edit the exact number if they want
		- these 3 things gives the user to both set the UV visually ON the actual image, and then also programatically.
		- the only thing i am considering is if i should allow dragging of the dots on the image as it might be hard and i want to write as little imgui code as possible because id rather just replace imgui with my own UI stuff later
		- the one good thing is that the more accurate i make the imgui code now the better prepared i will be to make the switch because I will know exactly what i need from my engines own UI system to be able to recreate the engine gui
- add ability to render font
- i need to add components at some point:
	- attribute component (multi)
	- collider component (multi)
	- rigid body component (unique)
	- particle component (dont know yet its so far away)
- add sound
- add physics
- add entity picking in the editor
- move away from "managed" structs. aka ones that keep reference to their own allocator, in favor of unmanaged and just passing around allocators more explicitly.
