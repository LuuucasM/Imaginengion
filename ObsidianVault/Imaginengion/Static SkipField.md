### Skip Field
- Inspiration: The Advanced “Jump-Counting” Skipfield Pattern - By Matthew Bently
- talk about how i was looking for a way to iterate through components without having to check IF every different component type belonged to an abritrary entity because I wanted to create a very strict ECS for the engine and therefore envisioned there being several components and as more components were added the more "checks" would need to happen as i iterate over components of entities so I wanted a way to mitigate that cost a bit, and after some digging i found this paper which allows me to iterate and "skip" over components that an entity doesnt have. This means when iterating over the components of an entity, not only can i save time by entirely skipping over component types that the entity doesnt have, but I also can eliminate the if-statement check seeing if the entity has the component. It does cost extra memory per entity but will allow the ECS to scale well as component types are added. Also going back to one of the principles of me designing the engine. Even though it takes a bit more memory, I would like to sacrifice memory for speed, but also because of zig compile time, I can do things like calculate the exact number of bits I would need per entity, which means that I can minimize space, compared to other languages which restricts you to a small set of integer types (like u16, u32, u64 mainly).
