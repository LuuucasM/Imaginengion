- add more testing and assertions
- add sound
- add physics
- make animation system
- add entity picking in the editor
- move away from "managed" structs. aka ones that keep reference to their own allocator, in favor of unmanaged and just passing around allocators more explicitly.
- i need to add components at some point:
	- attribute component (multi)
	- collider component (unique) (for this need to spawn child entity so that it has its own transform)
	- rigid body component (unique)
	- particle component (dont know yet its so far away)
- make event manager clear and free / clear retaining capacity an option in the editor. give it some default of like 10 or something but then make it 
- maybe in the future i can introduce like saved editor states where you can like hotkey or save specific scene setups so you can use later?
- split these mega shaders into smaller shaders so like a .vert and .frag instead of one big .glsl that we parse through
- add a function to scene_layer to "spawn player" which is an entity which has a component like PlayerComponent which contains the data related to the player. 
	- then i can for example on scene_layer.OnSceneStart I can spawn a player -> then somehow take control of an entity with a controller component, and then 
	- Then in scene scripts like OnSceneStart you can spawn a player and then set that players "ToControlEntity" to a specified entity
- fix bug where if you minimize it crashes because imgui begin/end children dont match
- does alt + f4 work natively with every program or does it need to be implemented?
- add a way to export the game into its standalone
- make it so u cant make scenes or anything until you have a project selected first
- Editor settings file
- Add localization for Korean
- add in reinforcement learning to the ECS for sorting components lists
- expose a way to use internal engine assets to the editor
	- like for example if something is white texture and then i change it, i have no way of changing it back to white texture if i change my mind 
	- i can either expose the engine assets OR add some X button that will return the value back to default but I think just exposing engine assets is better and who knows maybe in the future engine assets will contain a whole lots of nice goodies to make dev lives easier
